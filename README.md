# Code Forces Problem Solutions
## Introduction
This Repo Basically Just contains solutions of (not)all solutions of my submissions, this is for my record and your refernce, since I am not a competitive programmer right now, I like to keep my code simple yet powerful so, I guess this is idle for you and if you are an official in some big U.S. Company, Thanks for Viewing my Repo!
## What Langauge is Used
I like using a Mix of most of the programming languages but, for the sake of this Repo and my Programming Career I am using Just C++ or Sometimes C as well, though both are just identical. 
## Problems
As you might have seen my algorithmic implementation is not so good and my code is not that powerful yet, but it can be worked around for a beginner, as I progress you might see a change in my programming abilities and by the time I graduate Year 12, 3 Years to go, I might call myself a competitive programmer!
## Credits
All of the Credit Goes to Nav P. I wrote everything even this README.md in my terminal, and don't ever STEAL MY CREDIT!! Thanks!
